Below is CCSF's Vision Statement:
CCSF shall provide a sustainable and accessible environment where we 
support and encourage student possibilities by building on the vibrancy 
of San Francisco and where we are guided by the principles of inclusiveness, 
integrity, innovation, creativity, and quality. Empowered through resources, 
collegiality, and public support, the college will provide diverse communities 
with excellent educational opportunities and services. We will inspire 
participatory global citizenship grounded in critical thinking and an engaged,
forward thinking student body.
